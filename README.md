### Description
Artificial intelligence is a wide-ranging and applicable branch of computer science with lots of interaction with other fields. In this workshop, we want to explore this interdisciplinary field of study from academic views to industrial ones. AI is constantly growing and because of that, we should learn it perfectly for a successful future. This presentation can be decomposed into five sections. At first, we explain what and why questions and their answers about AI. For example AI definition and its application, why we should learn it, it's useful for me or not, and etc. After that, we argue this kind of topic in the second part: different learning paradigm in AI, how we can use these paradigms to solve problems, and etc. In the next part, we talk about python programming language and the implementation of some AI-based systems with it. In this section, our focus will be on machine learning and deep learning paradigms as our toolkits for solving problems. In the fourth section, the real application of AI in the national and international corporations will be considered, If we have extra time, we can have a very short speech about some predictions about the future of AI or AI-based industry. After this journey, we sum up the workshop with the conclusion and learning path of AI in more detail
